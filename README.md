# Consent API

Here is a basic rest API implementation for consent project. There are two endpoints
* GET /consents : with this one the user could retrieve the current consents saved in a local json file
* POST /consent : with this one the user could save a new consent in the local json file.

## Getting Started

### Installing

After cloning the project to the prefered folder you should run the following line.

```
npm install
```

After the installation is complete you could start the node app with

```
npm run serve
```

After that the node app will be ready to be consumed by the Angular app (Client app)
